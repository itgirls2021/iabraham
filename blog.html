    <h2> Discovering Cryptography</h2>
    <p>Israel Abraham / July 22nd, 2021</p>
    <p>  Cryptography. Such an interesting topic. The first time that I opened our schedule and saw “Cryptography Tuesday”, I had absolutley no idea what it was. Tuesday came, and I discovered this art of a field. You might be saying, 
      “What in the world is this girl talking about? Cryptography? That sounds like some ancient form of writing.”
      Well, you’re not wrong. In simple words, Cryptography is a form of writing through which people write a secret message, so it doesn’t make any sense to anyone except the person who has the key, or cipher. It’s been used as a form of art, and to communicate during wars, and on the fun side, some people try to crack the codes and discover a secret message just for fun.
       </p>
       <p>  One woman that was in this field is Elizabeth Friedman. She used to work for the government during WW2 and has cracked many of these secret messages. This is called cryptanalysis. Friedman played a major role during the war, but another person took the credit. Being a Female in the field was not common back then, and it was very hard. She hardly got any credit even though she was doing much of the work. She took her work to the grave. And yet, she did such and amazing job and was so talented. Elizabeth has become an inspiration to me. Her story goes to show that I can truly be and do whatever I want, despite my sex, gender identity, race or ethnicity. And guess what? You can too. It doesn’t matter who you are, what you are, what kind of situation you’re in or what society says about you. You can do anything that you set your mind to do.
       </p>
       <p>  Although cryptography has brought both negative and positive impacts to our world, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative. Yes, criminals and people with bad motives can use it for bad, but cryptanalysis counteracts that. Here are some positive impacts that cryptography has:
        •	Used to crack enemy codes and prevent destruction during wars.
        •	Used to send secret messages.
        •	Used to catch criminals and illegal activity.
        •	Used to keep state secrets secure.
        A simple example would be how Elizabeth, whom we talked about earlier, cracked the messages of alcohol smugglers in the 1930’s. Had she not, the crimes would have continued and so many more innocent lives would have been lost. Another one is during WW2. The war could have ended a lot more differently than what we know today. All this is thanks to cryptography. It truly is an art of a field.

         <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
           <p>Israel Abraham / July 28th, 2021</p>
           <p>  So, website recommendations. Let’s talk a bit about something we all know and have a love/hate relationship with- The You tube Algorithm. It’s always intrigued me how an app can see what I watch and guess what I would like- I mean, it, is an app. I, am a human. Apps don’t know humans, it’s supposed to be the other way around. Right? Wrong. </p>
           <p>  Machine learning is a way through which machines can see the data they have, in this case, what you tube videos you watch, analyze it and come up with recommendations that you should like. Sometimes however, those recommendations can be wrong.  </p>
           <p>  If these recommendations are based on what you previously watched and on what other users that watch the videos that you watch, the videos that are recommended to you may be things you find offensive and/or inappropriate. This can be seen in the political and media part of you tube, as some videos may be offensive towards certain political views. The comment sections are breeding grounds for arguments.  </p>
           <p> Another thing that I see is quite unfair is basing the level of importance of a certain topic covered in a video by the number of views. Videos with content that is truly beneficial to people isn’t what the majority of people watch. You can say that that’s just my opinion, but it’s the truth. What gets recommended is what the latest buzz is all about the newest topic that’s people can breed arguments over.  </p>
           <p> Problem is, amid all of this, fake news spreads like a virus. If it angers you, you don’t always stop to check if it’s actually legitimate before snapping back. This is something I’ve really found is unfair to the unsuspecting public. Sometimes, this fake news affects whole countries. That’s something that has affected my country before, but people just continued to spread things that they’re not even sure is true as long as it’s the latest buzz. </p>
           <p>  Unfortunately, these websites don’t do anything about it. I believe a way to solve this problem is to check the legitimacy of content before recommending it to anyone, especially the specific audience that it’s intended for in order to stop the spread of fake and offensive content.  </p>
           <p> However, we need to play our part in this process. Let’s not share things that we don’t know are true, and let’s try our best to be polite in the comments .  </p>
            <h3>Teachable Machine Assignment</h3>
           <p>  The teachable model that I created is meant to solve the problem that we have with our face recognition not recognizing our Face ID’s. Class one was me with glasses on, with a hat on, wrapped in a blanket and just my normal face. I called that model “Israel. Class 2 was filled with pictures of Otto. The machine learned to recognize me with different accessories on, and anything that was not me was termed “not Israel”. </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              <p>Thank you and have a great day.</p>
